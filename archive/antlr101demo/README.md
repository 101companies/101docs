# Headline 

A demonstration of technology metadata for ANTLR

# Motivation

How can we track a technology, such as ANTLR, within a software repository, such as 101companies? The 101meta language and approach is based on rules that declare roles of files, in fact, relationships between files (and fragments thereof) and technologies (and languages). This demonstration applies the 101meta approach to the parser generator ANTLR and shows how various files in a repository can serve as ANTLR library, input or output of applying the ANTLR parser generator, or a source that imports the ANTLR runtime.
