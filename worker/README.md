# worker

The goal of 101worker is to compute metadata about contributions and all other entities that 101companies is about. Examples for metadata include the language used in files (e.g. Java), technologies used in the source code (e.g. JUnit) or metrics such as lines of code for files and contributions. 

101worker organizes itself into different modules which are executed sequentially and serializes its output in files.
