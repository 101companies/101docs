Modules
=======

This folder will ideally one day contain high-level documentation about 101worker modules, so that their purpose is not just in the heads of the original developers.

See the [pull101repo documentation](pull101repo.md) as an example.

Use [this template](TEMPLATE.md) to write more documentation. The files should be called the same as their modules and be in Markdown format.
