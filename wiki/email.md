# Email Sending

## Email Configuration

Emails are sent via our google mail account. Please refer to the usual sources
for credentials if you require them. On our production server they are stored
in local environment variables and should be read from there.

## Google Configuration

In the [google mail settings](https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps), access for [less secure apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en) has to be turned on
to be able to send emails.

## Rails Configuration

For the rails configuration please check the local environment configurations
and the [rails documentation](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html).
